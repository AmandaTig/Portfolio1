# Dog Buddies

Welcome to the dog buddies website, I decided to create this dog buddies website to give awareness of the new dog park opening in the local area and allow people the opportunity to meet up.
This site is targeted towards people who enjoy dogs and want to meet new like minded people. This website will give the user information regarding opening times, costs and events planned as well as the location and contact details if they need to get in touch. There is a section on the site to sign up to the classes being run.
